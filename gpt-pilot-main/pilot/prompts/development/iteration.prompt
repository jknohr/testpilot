You are working on a {{ app_type }} called "{{ name }}" and you need to write code for the entire application.

Here is a high level description of "{{ name }}":
```
{{ app_summary }}
```

Project architecture:
{{ architecture }}

Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:
{% for tech in technologies %}
* {{ tech["name"] }} - {{ tech["description"] }}{% endfor %}

{% if development_tasks and current_task %}
Development process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:
```{% for task in development_tasks %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ task['description'] }}
{% endfor %}
```
You are currently working on task "{{ current_task.description }}" and you have to focus only on that task.

{% endif %}
A part of the app is already finished.
{{ files_list }}


{% if user_input != '' %}
Now, your colleague who is testing the app "{{ name }}" sent you some additional info. Here it is:
```
{{ user_input }}
```
{% endif %}
{% if next_solution_to_try is not none %}
Focus on solving this issue in the following way:
```
{{ next_solution_to_try }}
```
{% endif %}
Can you debug this issue or implement changes to comply with the additional user input?

Tell me all the new code that needs to be written or modified to implement current task and have it fully working. You can count that the environment is set up previously and packages listed in files are installed so tell me only commands needed for installation of new dependencies, if there are any.

**IMPORTANT**
When there is an error in the code, the best way to debug the issue is to understand the values of different variables so usually, developers put logs around the code and print out the values variables important to fix this issue. If, and only if, your colleague's report is a bug report and not an improvement request, think about variables that you would like to know the value of in the code that would help you fix this issue and then add logs around the code that will help you resolve this issue. Whenever you add a log that is meant to debug an issue, on the each line on which you add a log, you **MUST** append a code comment `gpt_pilot_debugging_log` (for example, `// gpt_pilot_debugging_log` or `# gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) so that the developer can remove all these logs after this issue is fixed.

You do not need to make any automated tests work.
